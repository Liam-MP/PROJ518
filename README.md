 Investigation Into Factors That Affect Wellbeing Using Machine Learning
 
Wellbeing exists as a multifaceted term which, at its core, seeks to define elements of intrinsic value to an individual. These elements combine to paint a picture of how well an individual can function and how they feel about their day-to-day life (Michaelson, Mahony and Schifferes, 2012).

Elements of wellbeing can be broadly categorised as either subjective (SWB), or objective (OWB). SWB is best understood as a person’s rating of their own life and ability to engage in activities that they value (Stone et al., 2013, p.5). This is a uniquely personal viewpoint, two people in a seemingly identical scenario could hold wildly differing opinions towards said scenario. OWB is harder to define given the multitude of dimensions that it covers. Voukelatou et al. (2020) suggest that OWB can be considered as the elements essential to driving wellbeing at a societal level. They go on to introduce the following as measurable dimensions of OWB: health, job opportunities, socioeconomic development, environment, safety and politics.

In 2010 the Office of National Statistics (ONS), began the ‘Measuring National well-being’ program in the UK. Everett (2015) explains the aim of this program is to develop a set of statistics to better equip people to understand and monitor wellbeing in the UK, this goes beyond previous, limited, measures of a nations progress such as GDP (gross domestic product). Everett continues to highlight the benefit of SWB measures and introduces 4 questions that have been added to ONS household surveys in order to further this program:

   •	Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?
   
   •	Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile? 
   
   •	Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?
   
   •	Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?
   
Answers to these questions are provided on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 is ‘not at all’ and 10 is ‘completely’. These questions will form the basis, or dependant variables, of the research posed in this project.

For this project, data collected by the ONS in the ‘national annual survey’ will be utilised to explore and identify factors that affect the SWB of the British population (Office for National Statistics, Social Survey Division, 2022). Contributory factors will be further analysed providing a view of how much each element adds to or detracts from measures of SWB. 

Data consists of the 4 SWB questions alongside an additional 517 variables covering education, employment, health, ethnicity and more. Results are provided for 217,666 persons representing each local and unitary authority within the UK.
